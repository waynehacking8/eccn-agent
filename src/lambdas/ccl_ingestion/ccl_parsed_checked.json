In non slapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation in a contacting high explosive material such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator.*"

TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)*\n\n*Technical Notes:*\n*1. For purposes of this entry, a \"mixture\" is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions.*\n\n*2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates.*\n\n*3.

Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates, isotopically-labeled forms or all possible stereoisomers) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.*\n\nList Based License Exceptions (See Part 740 for a Description of All License Exceptions)\n\n*LVS:* N/A\n\n*GBS:* N/A\n\nList of Items Controlled\n\n*Related Controls:* See USML Category XIV for related chemical agent binary precursors and key precursors \"subject to the ITAR\" (see [22 CFR parts 120](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-22/part-120 \"_blank\") through [130](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-22/part-130 \"_blank\")).\n\n*Related Definitions:* See \u00a7 770.2(k) of the EAR for synonyms for the chemicals listed in this entry.\n\n*Items:*\n\na.

Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, \"composite\", dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or \"laser\" irradiation.*\n\n*Note 1: CVD includes the following processes: Directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal decomposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes*.\n\n*Note 2: Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.*\n\n*Note 3: The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture.*\n\n*b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapor Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows:*\n\n*1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating;*\n\n*2. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;*\n\n*3. \"Laser\" Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave \"laser\" beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;*\n\n*4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition;*\n\n*Note: This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates.*\n\n*5. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process.*\n\n*c. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of:*\n\n*1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminum, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);*\n\n*2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and*\n\n*3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina.*\n\n*Note: The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1,030 K (757 \u00b0C) to 1,375 K (1,102 \u00b0C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating*.\n\n*d. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying.*\n\n>*Note 1: Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.*\n\n*Note 2: High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 \u00b0C) at 0.1 MPa.*\n\n*e. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating.*\n\n*f. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate.*\n\n*Note 1: The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporization of non-metallic coating materials.*\n\n*Note 2: Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition.*\n\n*g. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapor deposition or sputter deposition.*\n\n*Accompanying Technical Information to Table on Deposition Techniques:*\n\n*1.

Integrated circuits having one or more digital processing units having either of the following:\n\na.1. A 'total processing performance' of 4800 or more; *or*\n\na.2. A 'total processing performance' of 1600 or more and a 'performance density' of 5.92 or more.\n\nNote 1 to 3A090.a: *When a \"front-end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company is seeking to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) an \"applicable advanced logic integrated circuit,\" there is a presumption that the item is 3A090.a and designed or marketed for datacenters. If the \"front-end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company cannot overcome this presumption, then it must comply with all license requirements applicable to items specified in 3A090.a. However, this presumption does not apply to any entity other than the \"front-end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company. A \"front-end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company can overcome this presumption in any of the following three ways outlined in paragraphs a. through c. of this Note 1.*\n\n*a. If the designer of the \"applicable advanced logic integrated circuit\" is an approved or authorized integrated circuit designer, then a datasheet or other attestation of the 'total processing performance' and the 'performance density' from the approved or authorized integrated circuit designer indicating that the IC is not specified in 3A090.a will overcome the presumption for the \"front-end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company that the IC is specified in ECCN 3A090.a.*\n\n*(1) Approved integrated circuit designers are listed in supplement no. 6 to this part of the EAR;*\n\n*(2) Prior to April 13, 2026, authorized integrated circuit designers include all integrated circuit designers:*\n\n*(i) Headquartered in Taiwan or a destination specified in Country Group A:1 or A:5, that are neither located in nor have an ultimate parent headquartered in Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5 of supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR; and*\n\n*(ii) That have agreed to submit applicable information described in \u00a7 743.9(b) to the \"front-end fabricator,\" which the \"front-end fabricator\" must then report to BIS.*\n\n*(3) After April 13, 2026, authorized integrated circuit designers include any integrated circuit designer that both meets the criteria specified in subparagraph (2) and has submitted an application to become an approved integrated circuit designer. However, any company deemed an authorized IC designer after April 13, 2026, will cease to be an authorized IC designer 180 days after the submission of its application to become an approved IC designer.*\n\n*b. If the integrated circuit die is packaged by the \"front-end fabricator\" at a location outside of Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5 in supplement no. 1 to part 740, then the attestation of the \"front-end fabricator\" that (a) the \"aggregated approximated transistor count\" of the final packaged IC is below 30 billion transistors, or (b) the final packaged IC does not contain high-bandwidth memory and that the \"aggregated approximated transistor count\" of the final packaged IC is below (i) 35 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2027; or (ii) 40 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2029 or thereafter, then this overcomes the presumption by the \"front-end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company that the IC is specified in ECCN 3A090.a.*\n\n*c. If the integrated circuit is packaged by an approved \"OSAT\" company listed in supplement no. 7 to part 740 of the EAR, then the attestation of the approved \"OSAT\" company that (a) the \"aggregated approximated transistor count\" of the final packaged IC is below 30 billion transistors, or (b) the final packaged IC does not contain high-bandwidth memory and that the \"aggregated approximated transistor count\" of the final packaged IC is below (i) 35 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2027; or (ii) 40 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2029 or thereafter, then this overcomes the presumption by the \"front-end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company that the IC is specified in ECCN 3A090.a.*\n\n*d. It is not sufficient for the \"front-end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company to confirm the ECCN by relying on the attestation of the end user or other party to the transaction, except under one of the three ways enumerated in paragraphs a. through c. of this note. In the absence of an attestation of the 'total processing performance' and the 'performance density' by an approved integrated circuit designer listed in supplement no. 6 to part 740 of the EAR, the \"front-end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company must presume that any logic integrated circuit produced using the \"16/14 nanometer node\" or below, or using a non-planar transistor architecture and destined for a commodity with an (a) \"aggregated approximated transistor count\" of the final packaged IC is below 30 billion transistors, or (b) the final packaged IC does not contain high-bandwidth memory and that the \"aggregated approximated transistor count\" of the final packaged IC is below (i) 35 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2027; or (ii) 40 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2029 or thereafter, or where the \"aggregated approximated transistor count,\" of the final, packaged integrated circuit cannot be confirmed by the \"front-end fabricator,\" or an approved \"OSAT\" company listed in supplement no. 7 to part 740 of the EAR, is specified in ECCN 3A090.a and designed or marketed for a datacenter.*\n\nTechnical Note 1 to 3A090.a: *The 'approximated transistor count' of a die is the 'transistor density' of the die multiplied by the area of the die measured in square millimeters. The 'transistor density' of the die is the number of transistors that can be fabricated per square millimeter for the process node used to manufacture the die. To calculate the number of 'approximated transistor count' of a die, a \"front end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company has two options. First, the \"front end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company may take the transistor density of the process node used to manufacture the die and multiply this density by the area of the die. This number may be significantly higher than the true transistor count, but if the result is below the relevant transistor threshold, then the \"front end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company can be confident that the die in question will not exceed that threshold. Second, to adjudicate edge cases, the \"front end fabricator\" or \"OSAT\" company may use standard design verification tools to estimate the number of (both active and passive) transistors on the die using the GDS file.*\n\n*b. Integrated circuits having one or more digital processing units having either of the following:*\n\n*b.1. A 'total processing performance' of 2400 or more and less than 4800 and a 'performance density' of 1.6 or more and less than 5.92, or*\n\n*b.2. A 'total processing performance' of 1600 or more and a 'performance density' of 3.2 or more and less than 5.92.*\n\nNote 2 to 3A090.a and 3A090.b: *3A090.a and 3A090.b do not apply to items that are not designed or marketed for use in datacenters and do not have a 'total processing performance' of 4800 or more. For 3A090.a and 3A090.b items that are not designed or marketed for use in datacenters and that have a 'total processing performance' of 4800 or more, see license exceptions NAC and ACA.*\n\nNote 3 to 3A090.a and 3A090.b: *Integrated circuits specified by 3A090 include graphical processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), neural processors, in-memory processors, vision processors, text processors, co-processors/accelerators, adaptive processors, field-programmable logic devices (FPLDs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Examples of integrated circuits are in the Note to 3A001.a.*\n\nNote 4 to 3A090.a and 3A090.b: *For integrated circuits that are excluded from ECCN 3A090 under Note 2 or 3 to 3A090, those ICs are also not applicable for classifications made under ECCNs 3A001.z, 4A003.z, 4A004.z, 4A005.z, 4A090, 5A002.z, 5A004.z, 5A992.z, 5D002.z, or 5D992.z because those other CCL classifications are based on the incorporation of an integrated circuit that meets the control parameters under ECCN 3A090 or otherwise meets or exceeds the control parameters or ECCNs 3A090 or 4A090. The performance parameters under ECCN 3A090.c are not used for determining whether an item is classified in a .z ECCN. See the Related Controls paragraphs of ECCNs 3A001.z, 4A003.z, 4A004.z, 4A005.z, 4A090, 5A002.z, 5A004.z, 5A992.z, 5D002.z, or 5D992.z.*\n\nTechnical Note 2 to 3A090.a and 3A090.b:\n\n*1. 'Total processing performance' ('TPP') is 2 \u00d7 'MacTOPS' \u00d7 'bit length of the operation', aggregated over all processing units on the integrated circuit.*\n\n*a. For purposes of 3A090, 'MacTOPS' is the theoretical peak number of Tera (10**12**) operations per second for multiply-accumulate computation (D = A \u00d7 B + C).*\n\n*b. The 2 in the 'TPP' formula is based on industry convention of counting one multiply-accumulate computation, D = A \u00d7 B + C, as 2 operations for purpose of datasheets. Therefore, 2 \u00d7 MacTOPS may correspond to the reported TOPS or FLOPS on a datasheet.*\n\n*c. For purposes of 3A090, 'bit length of the operation' for a multiply-accumulate computation is the largest bit-length of the inputs to the multiply operation.*\n\n*d. Aggregate the TPPs for each processing unit on the integrated circuit to arrive at a total. 'TPP' = TPP1 + TPP2 + . . . . + TPPn (where n is the number or processing units on the integrated circuit).*\n\n*2. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is assumed to be the highest value the manufacturer claims in annual or brochure for the integrated circuit. For example, the 'TPP' threshold of 4800 can be met with 600 tera integer operations (or 2 \u00d7 300 'MacTOPS') at 8 bits or 300 tera FLOPS (or 2 \u00d7 150 'MacTOPS') at 16 bits. If the integrated circuit is designed for MAC computation with multiple bit lengths that achieve different 'TPP' values, the highest 'TPP' value should be evaluated against parameters in 3A090.*\n\n*3. For integrated circuits specified by 3A090 that provide processing of both sparse and dense matrices, the 'TPP' values are the values for processing of dense matrices (e.g., without sparsity).*\n\n*4. 'Performance density' is 'TPP' divided by 'applicable die area'. For purposes of 3A090, 'applicable die area' is measured in millimeters squared and includes all die area of logic dies manufactured with a process node that uses a non-planar transistor architecture.*\n\nc. High bandwidth memory (HBM) having a 'memory bandwidth density' greater than 2 gigabytes per second per square millimeter.\n\nTechnical Note 1 to 3A090.c:\n*'Memory bandwidth density' is the memory bandwidth measured in gigabytes per second divided by the area of the package or stack measured in square millimeters. In the case where a stack is contained in a package, use the memory bandwidth of the packaged device and the area of the package. High bandwidth memory (HBM) includes dynamic random access memory integrated circuits, regardless of whether they conform to the JEDEC standards for high bandwidth memory (HBM), provided they have a 'memory bandwidth density' greater than 2 gigabytes per second per square millimeter. This control does not cover co-packaged integrated circuits with both HBM and logic integrated circuit where the dominant function of the co-packaged integrated circuit is processing. It does include HBM permanently affixed to a logic integrated circuit designed as a control interface and incorporating a physical layer (PHY) function.*"

This entry does not apply to adiabatic (or annealing) quantum computers.*\n\n*Note 2:*\n*Items specified by 4A906 may not necessarily physically contain any qubits. For example, quantum computers based on photonic schemes do not permanently contain a physical item that can be identified as a qubit. Instead, the photonic qubits are generated while the computer is operating and then later discarded.*\n\n*Note 3:*\n*Items specified by 4A906.b include semiconductor, superconducting, and photonic qubit chips and chip arrays; surface ion trap arrays; other qubit confinement technologies; and coherent interconnects between such items.*\n\n*Note 4:*\n*4A906.c applies to items designed for calibrating, initializing, manipulating or measuring the resident qubits of a quantum computer.*\n\n*Technical Notes:*\n*For the purposes of 4A906:*\n\n*1. A 'physical qubit' is a two-level quantum system used to represent the elementary unit of quantum logic by means of manipulations and measurements that are not error corrected. 'Physical qubits' are distinguished from logical qubits, in that logical qubits are error-corrected qubits comprised of many 'physical qubits'.*\n\n*2. 'Fully controlled' means the 'physical qubit' can be calibrated, initialized, gated, and read out, as necessary.*\n\n*3. 'Connected' means that two-qubit gate operations can be performed between any arbitrary pair of the available 'working' 'physical qubits'. This does not necessarily entail all-to-all connectivity.*\n\n*4. 'Working' means that the 'physical qubit' performs universal quantum computational work according to the system specifications for qubit operational fidelity.*\n\n*5. Supporting 34 or more 'fully controlled', 'connected', 'working' 'physical qubits' refers to the capability of a quantum computer to confine, control, measure and process the quantum information embodied in 34 or more 'physical qubits'.*\n\n*6. 'C-NOT error' is the average physical gate error for the nearest-neighbor two-'physical qubit' Controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gates.*"

'Parameters' refers to any value learned during training (e.g., network weights, biases, etc.). 'Parameters' for an artificial intelligence model are also known as model weights.*\n\n*2. 'Operations' refers to mathematical operations used for pre-training and any subsequent training, such as fine-tuning the pre-trained model, but does not include the collection and curation of the input training data. Training 'operations' should account for operations required to perform all steps in the pre-training and subsequent training process, including those for forward and backward propagation for all relevant layers, pooling, and convolutions, regardless of the implementation and hardware limitations, and applied to all relevant operations. For example, consider a model composed of a single densely connected layer with I input neurons, O output neurons, and no biases being trained with backpropagation. Such a model would have a total of N = I \\* O learned parameters. Each forward pass would require N multiply accumulate operations, or (assuming floating point arithmetic) 2N FLOP. Each backward pass would require 2N multiply accumulate operations, or 4N FLOP. Then, in total, each training data point would require 6N FLOP. Training on a data set of size D would require 6ND total FLOP.*\n\n*3. If more than ten percent of the 'operations' involve training on data that was not \"published\" as defined in \u00a7 734.7(a) and was generated by a single data-generation model, then 'operations' the data-generation model used to generate the data should be counted, and if the data-generation model's 'parameters' were not \"published,\" then the training 'operations' used to train the data-generating model should be counted as well. A single data-generation model includes variants of the same model, such as different checkpoints or fine-tuned variants. If multiple models with 'parameters' that were not \"published\" were used to generate data used for more than ten percent of the training 'operations,' then only the training 'operations' of the data-generation model using the most training 'operations' should be counted. No actual training 'operation' should be counted more than once, so if data-generation model A is used to train data-generation model B and data-generation model C, and models B and C are used to train model D, then the operations to train A are only added to the number of operations for model D once.*\n\n*Notes:*\n*1. In accordance with \u00a7 734.7 of the EAR, 4E091 does not control the 'parameters' of any artificial intelligence model that have been \"published\" as defined in \u00a7 734.7(a). 4E091 also does not control the 'parameters' of any artificial intelligence model derived from a model whose parameters have been 'published,' except where the model has been derived using additional training 'operations' that constitute more than 2.5 \u00d7 1025 'operations' or more than 25 percent of the training 'operations' defined in Note 2, whichever is higher.*\n\n*2. 4E091 does not control the 'parameters' of any artificial intelligence model trained utilizing fewer 'operations' than the number needed, based on the most efficient \"published\" methods to train artificial intelligence models, to train an artificial intelligence model as capable, according to an aggregate of widely used benchmarks, as the most advanced artificial intelligence model that has been \"published\" as defined in \u00a7 734.7(a) of the EAR. To provide certainty for this exclusion, the number of 'operations' needed should not decrease with algorithmic improvements.*\n\n*2.a. An exporter may determine whether an AI model falls within this exclusion by either:*\n\n*2.a.1. Self classifying by relying on guidance published by BIS or technical opinions issued by the U.S. AI Safety Institute and the Department of Energy, should such opinions have been published, or*\n\n*2.a.2.

The operator then removes the LRU and replaces it with a spare. (2) 'Maintenance Level II': The defective LRU is sent to the maintenance workshop (the manufacturer's or that of the operator responsible for level II maintenance). At the maintenance workshop, the malfunctioning LRU is tested by various appropriate means to verify and localize the defective Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA) module responsible for the failure. This SRA is removed and replaced by an operative spare. The defective SRA (or possibly the complete LRU) is then shipped to the manufacturer.

They are listed in ECCN 9A004.a through .f in order to harmonize 9A004 with the Wassenaar Arrangement Dual-Use List, even though the controls for these items are found under ECCN 9A515 and to direct exporters, reexporters, and transferors to* s*ee USML Category IV for 9A004.a. See UMSL Category IV for 9A004.a. See ECCN 9A515 for 9A004.b through .f, and .h. See this ECCN 9A004 for .g, .h, .r, .s, and .u through .y.*\n\nList Based License Exceptions (See Part 740 for a Description of All License Exceptions)\n\n*LVS:* $1500\n\n*GBS:* N/A\n\nSpecial Conditions for STA\n\n*STA:* (1) Paragraph (c)(1) of License Exception STA (\u00a7 740.20(c)(1) of the EAR) may not be used for \"spacecraft\" in ECCNs 9A515.a.1, a.2, a.3, or a.4, \"sub-orbital craft,\" or items in 9A515.g, unless determined by BIS to be eligible for License Exception STA in accordance with \u00a7 740.20(g) (License Exception STA eligibility requests for certain 9x515 and \"600 series\" items). (2) License Exception STA may not be used if the \"spacecraft\" controlled in ECCN 9A515.a.1, a.2, a.3, or a.4 contains a separable or removable propulsion system described in USML Category IV(d)(2) or USML Category XV(e)(12) and designated MT. (3) Paragraph (c)(2) of License Exception STA (\u00a7 740.20(c)(2) of the EAR) may not be used for any item in 9A515.\n\nList of Items Controlled\n\n*Related Controls:* Spacecraft, launch vehicles and related articles that are described on the USML, and technical data (including \"software\") directly related thereto, and all services (including training) directly related to the integration of any satellite or spacecraft to a launch vehicle, including both planning and onsite support, or furnishing any assistance (including training) in the launch failure analysis or investigation for items in ECCN 9A515.a, are \"subject to the ITAR.\" All other \"spacecraft,\" as enumerated below and defined in \u00a7 772.1, are subject to the controls of this ECCN. See also ECCNs 3A001, 3A002, 3A991, 3A992, 6A002, 6A004, 6A008, and 6A998 for specific \"space-qualified\" items, 7A004 and 7A104 for star trackers, and 9A004 for the International Space Station (ISS), the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and \"specially designed\" \"parts\" and \"components\" therefor. See USML Category XI(c) for controls on certain \"Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit\" (\"MMIC\") amplifiers. See ECCN 9A610.g for pressure suits used for high altitude aircraft.\n\n*Related Definitions:* 'Microcircuit' means a device in which a number of passive or active elements are considered as indivisibly associated on or within a continuous structure to perform the function of a circuit.\n\n*Items:*\n\n\"Spacecraft\" and other items described in ECCN 9A515 remain subject to the EAR even if exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) with defense articles \"subject to the ITAR\" integrated into and included therein as integral parts of the item. In all other cases, such defense articles are subject to the ITAR. For example, a 9A515.a \"spacecraft\" remains \"subject to the EAR\" even when it is exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) with a \"hosted payload\" described in USML Category XV(e)(17) incorporated therein. In all other cases, a \"hosted payload\" performing a function described in USML Category XV(a) always remains a USML item. The removal of the defense article subject to the ITAR from the spacecraft is a retransfer under the ITAR and would require an ITAR authorization, regardless of the CCL authorization the spacecraft is exported under. Additionally, transfer of technical data regarding the defense article subject to the ITAR integrated into the spacecraft would require an ITAR authorization.\n\na. \"Spacecraft,\" including satellites, and space vehicles and \"sub-orbital craft,\" whether designated developmental, experimental, research or scientific, not described in USML Category XV or described in ECCN 9A004.r, .u, or .w, that:\n\na.1.
